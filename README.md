## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
- A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project
- `pnpm`, `npm`, or `yarn` for package management

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dembasowmr/maarif-compass.git
    cd maarif-compass
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    Populate the `.env.local` file with your Firebase project credentials. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for details.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Firebase Setup

This project requires a Firebase project to handle authentication, database, and file storage.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2.  **Create a Web App:**
    - Inside your project, click the "Web" icon (`</>`) to create a new web application.
    - Give it a name and register the app.
    - Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. You will need these values for your `.env.local` file.

3.  **Enable Authentication:**
    - Go to the "Authentication" section in the Firebase console.
    - Click "Get started".
    - On the "Sign-in method" tab, enable the **Google** provider. Provide a project support email when prompted.

4.  **Set up Firestore Database:**
    - Go to the "Firestore Database" section.
    - Click "Create database" and start in **production mode**.
    - Choose a location for your database.
    - **Security Rules:** Go to the "Rules" tab and paste the contents of `securityRules.ts` from this project. This file contains development-ready rules. **These are insecure and must be updated for a production environment.**

5.  **Set up Cloud Storage:**
    - Go to the "Storage" section.
    - Click "Get started" and follow the prompts to create a default storage bucket.
    - **Security Rules:** Go to the "Rules" tab and update the rules to allow reads and writes for authenticated users. A good starting point is:
      ```
      rules_version = '2';
      service firebase.storage {
        match /b/{bucket}/o {
          match /{allPaths=**} {
            allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
          }
        }
      }
      ```

6.  **Generate a Service Account Key (for Admin Actions):**
    - In the Firebase Console, go to "Project settings" (click the gear icon).
    - Go to the "Service accounts" tab.
    - Click "Generate new private key". A JSON file will be downloaded.
    - You will need the contents of this file for the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_BASE64` environment variable.

---

## Environment Variables

You need to create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add the following variables.

```env
# Firebase Client Configuration (from Firebase Console Web App settings)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=

# Firebase Admin SDK (for server-side actions)
# Base64-encode the entire service account JSON file you downloaded
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_BASE64=

# reCAPTCHA Keys (for contact form)
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=
NEXT_RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=

# CompassIA Agent URL (for Phase 2)
NEXT_PUBLIC_COMPASSIA_AGENT_URL=
```

To Base64-encode your service account key, you can use an online tool or run this command in your terminal:
`cat /path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json | base64` (on macOS/Linux).

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure with clear separation of concerns.

```

## Internationalization (i18n)

The application uses `i18next` and `react-i18next` for handling translations.
-   Language files are located in `public/locales/{language_code}/{namespace}.json`.
-   The default namespace is `common`.
-   The `useTranslation` hook is used in components to access translated strings.
